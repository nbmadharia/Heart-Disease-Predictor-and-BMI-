# Heart Disease Predictor and BMI


This project is based on KNN classifier model. Where we already have the correct output and set of features associated with that output. 
We use some algorithms and try to train them with the existing data and then try to predict the output of new data with only features associated 
with them. KNN tries to find similarities between predictors and values that are within the dataset.

About Dataset: we have many columns
This project is based on how common the heart disease is and predict by entering the data related to your body. Also It has been noticed that obese people will more likely to have heart diseases. So, I have added that attribute also.
